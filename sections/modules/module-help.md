Module - help
=============

The help module listens for the HELP keywords to applications and makes sure
that the response the application sends is delivered as Free To End User
(FTEU) message.

The module doesnâ€™t do anything besides that. It delegates the processing
to the client application, and wraps the response in the correct
structure.
