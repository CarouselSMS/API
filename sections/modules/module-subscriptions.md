Module - subscriptions
======================

When enabled, the subscriptions module controls whole cycle of subscription management and enables the applications to use subscription registration, tagging and message sending.

The module monitors incoming messages for keywords and processes them when detected. This happens without passing the messages to the your application. Keywords and responses are entered in the application configuration UI, under Subscription Configuration, on per-application basis.

All subscribers are registered in the Subscriptions table and can be tagged into groups by your application.
