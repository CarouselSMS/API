Module - subscriptions
======================

Subscriptions module when enabled controls whole cycle of subscription
management and enables the applications to use subscription
registration, tagging and message sending.

The module monitors incoming messages for the keywords and processes
them when detected without passing the messages to the client
applications. Keywords and responses to them are entered in the
Subscription Configuration on per-application basis.

All subscribers are registered in the Subscriptions table and can be
tagged by the client application for the purpose of grouping.
